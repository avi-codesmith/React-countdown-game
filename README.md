## 🧠 About the Game

**The Almost Final Countdown** is a timing-based mini-game built with **React** where players must  
**start a hidden timer and stop it as close as possible** to the target time — without any visual countdown.

Sounds easy?  
Try **10 seconds… or more** 😈  
Your brain vs time perception.
